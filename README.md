2. **Readable code, detailed documentation, interactive tutorials** &rarr; easier understanding of the algorithms.
3. **Modular implementation** &rarr; develop new algorithm in the module of your interest.

# Installation
**Requirements**:

* Python >= 3.6 
* PyTorch >= 1.10.2 (NumPy included)
* Matplotlib

<!-- # Information-Driven Learning and Planning -->
<!-- Learning in animals, humans, and robots involves the active gathering of informative sensor data for building a better model of the world. Intelligent agents need to actively explore the environment to accomplish the assigned tasks in an partially observable environment due to the constrained physical embodiment. In some scenarios, e.g., autonomous exploration and environmental monitoring, gathering informative sensor data to build an accurate model per se is the main goal of the task. -->
