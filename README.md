# What is this? üßê
PyPolo is a Python library for <b>Robotic Information Gathering</b>

<img src="./docs/images/caramel_gather_info.gif" width="200"/>

This is my fluffy friend -- Caramel -- learning about a drone she has never seen.
She listens attentively, touches and sniffs the drone actively, and changes her angle of view to gather more information about this unknown object.

Can robots also exhibit such *active information acquisition* behavior?

## What is Robotic Information Gathering? ü§ñ
Robotic Information Gathering is a research topic in Robotics that aims to answer the following question:

**How does a robot (team) collect *observations* to *efficiently* build an *accurate* model of a physical process under robot *embodiment constraints*?**

To endow robots with the ability to gather valuable information actively, we need to develop an *integrated planning and learning* system. The learning algorithm should provide the uncertainty of its prediction, and the planning algorithm should consider the uncertainty to collect informative observations or make informed decisions.

This is the workflow of an example application: active underwater elevation mapping using an Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV).
Other applications include but not limited to autonomous exploration, 3D reconstruction or inspection, search and rescue, environmental modeling and monitoring, active dynamics learning, and active localization.

## Why would I use this library? ü§∑
As we can see from the above diagram, planning relies on the learning component, while learning depends on the data collected by the planner and controller.
Compared to studying planning, learning, or control problems alone, the interdisciplinary nature of Robotic Information Gathering can make it relatively daunting for beginners to get started.
I hope PyPolo can lower the entry bar of this domain.
PyPolo also helps researchers to focus on a single aspect of the problem when prototyping their algorithms and comparing their proposed algorithms with existing ones. 

This library provides
* **interactive tutorials** to guide you to the world of Robotic Information Gathering,
* **detailed documentation and readable code** to help you understand the basic idea of each algorithm,
* **minimum dependency and cross-platform support** so that you can start your robotics journey without getting stuck in [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) and [Robot Operating System (ROS)](https://www.ros.org/),
* **modular implementation** to facilitate the development of new algorithms,
* **ROS integration guide** to demonstrate how to algorithms can be deployed to simulated/real robots.
