# PyPolo
PyPolo, inspired by [Marco Polo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Polo) -- the great explorer, is a Python library for research and education on information-driven learning and planning.

# Information-Driven Learning and Planning
Learning in animals, humans, and robots involves the active gathering of informative sensor data for building a better model of the world. Intelligent agents need to actively explore the environment to accomplish the assigned tasks in an partially observable environment due to the constrained physical embodiment. In some scenarios, e.g., autonomous exploration and environmental monitoring, gathering informative sensor data to build an accurate model per se is the main goal of the task.

# Features
1. Keep minimum dependency to facilitate research and education.
2. Emphasize readability and documentation for easier understanding of the algorithms.
